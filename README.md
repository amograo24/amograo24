I am **Amog Rao**, a Junior Year BTech Student at Plaksha Univesity, majoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in anything that makes my brain sweat or has community impact. I find a good intersection in the use of **AI/ML in Healthcare or Education**! And a way to translate that interest into a meaningful outputs is to have deployable solutions, open-source projects, or research papers that could be used by the community.

I am currently working on two Deep Learning projects that revolve around (1) Geospatial Analysis of Lakes and (2) Lesion Segmentation within Neonatal Brains.

## ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:

*Note to interviewers:

1. **[Multi-Label Urban Road Morphology Classification Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/amograo24/IISc-Road-Morphology-Classification)**
   - Developed deep learning models to classify Indian road patterns, achieving improved generalizability through transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.
  
2. **[Pneumothorax Segmentation with Bone Suppression](https://github.com/Pneumothorax-Segmentation-Model/Pneumothorax-Segmentation)**
   - Developed deep learning models to classify Indian road patterns, achieving improved generalizability through transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.

3. **[AutoParcel](https://github.com/amograo24/AutoParcelNext)**
   - Co-led the development of a secure parcel management system deployed at Plaksha University, optimizing parcel logging and collection processes, resulting in significant time reductions and increased user satisfaction.
  
4. **[Unified Health Interface](https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo2)**
   - Co-led the development of a secure parcel management system deployed at Plaksha University, optimizing parcel logging and collection processes, resulting in significant time reductions and increased user satisfaction.

5. **[TaskLabs](https://github.com/amograo24/TaskLabs-Public)**
   - Developed a perturbation-based algorithm to optimize city pathfinding, analyzing cost efficiency and performance.

6. **[Rao Academy](https://github.com/amograo24/RaoAcademy)**
   - Developed a perturbation-based algorithm to optimize city pathfinding, analyzing cost efficiency and performance.
     
7. **[BookMyShow - Database Schema](https://github.com/amograo24/BookMyShow-SQL-Project)**
   - Developed a perturbation-based algorithm to optimize city pathfinding, analyzing cost efficiency and performance.
